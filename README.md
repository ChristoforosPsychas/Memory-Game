### Instructions

This final project has HTML, CSS styling and Javascript functionality to display a dynamic and interactive version of the Memory Game project. 

To get started, open the `index.html` file in your browser and start playing!

### How The Game Works

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

### Star Rating System

This Memory Game has a star rating system. After a specific number of moves that the player will make, the star rating will be reduced. A player can only achieve 3 star ratings. Three, which is the best. Two, which is a medium rating, and one which is the worst. 

### Dependencies and Resources

This project does not use any dependencies (such as Bootstrap).

### Development

This Memory Game Project is made by Christoforos Psychas for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

### Future Work

There are plans for expanding this memory game project and include various features, such as flip animations, match and unmatch animations and more, hopefully.
